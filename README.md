## Overview
This document demonstrates my end-to-end approach in planning, monitoring, and controlling the execution of the LC1 Intake Substation (66kV/22kV)—a critical power-up node for the JRL MRT project. The micro-scheduling strategy provided visibility for over 60+ interdependent activities, ensuring the timely energization milestone was met on 06 January 2025

## Execution Planning – Step-by-Step

1. **WBS Extraction**  
   - Derived LC1-relevant activities from Primavera L1.
   - Mapped system tags (e.g., GIS, Transformer, Installation and Testing) to scope.

2. **Work Package Breakdown**  
   - Logical grouping by:
     - Delivery of Electrical equipment and materials
     - Containment
     - Cable pulling
     - Equipment erection
     - Testing & commissioning

3. **Sequence & Dependency Mapping**  
   - Realistic sequencing based on on-ground workflows.
   - Example:
     - Equipment → Containment → Cable Laying → Glanding → Termination → testing and Commssioning → SCADA system

4. **Data-Driven Scheduling**  
   - Applied vendor delivery lead time, manpower analysis, EHS access windows.
   - Duration buffers created based on site historical productivity data.

5. **Live Monitoring & Control**  
   - Weekly updates gathered.
   - Tracked using Excel dashboards with:
     - Green: Completed
     - Blue: In Progress
     - Red: At Risk/Critical
     - Yellow: Delayed but recoverable

  - GIS Installation & Gas Filling Procedure
  - Transformer installation and Oil filling 
  - Cable Glanding, Termination, and IR Testing
  - Testing and commissioning
- **Used Site-Specific Layouts** to plan space allocation, inter-bay access, and control cable routing.
- Incorporated **Safe Work Procedures** and **LTA/WSH Mandates** for:
  - Hot Works
  - Confined Space works
  - Lifting operation
  - Work at height

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

| Issue | Impact | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Delay in 66kV Transformer Bushing | Risk to Power ON | Cold test and relay panel activities advanced to absorb delay |
| GIS spare parts from Siemens | Threat to functional checks | Parallel system (LV) tested first, dummy loads used for GIS simulation |
| Site Access Constraints | T&C Execution Lag | Re-sequenced scope to allow night shifts and parallel panels commissioning |

✅ **Result**: Mitigated all major risks with **no slippage** on energization milestone.

---

## Testing & Commissioning Strategy

- **Parallel T&C Execution Plan**:
  - Testing began **per system group** (GIS, Relay Panel, Transformer).
  - Cold checks and dry runs released **before full installation completion**.
- **Smart Overlapping**:
  - GIS checks using simulation
  - Relay panel energized before final cable terminations
- **Outcome**:
  - Reduced idle wait time
  - Increased schedule flexibility
  - Absorbed logistic uncertainties
