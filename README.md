## Execution Planning – Step-by-Step

1. **WBS Extraction**  
   - Derived LC1-relevant activities from Primavera L1.
   - Mapped system tags (e.g., GIS, Transformer, SCADA) to scope.

2. **Work Package Breakdown**  
   - Logical grouping by:
     - Containment
     - Cable pulling
     - Equipment erection
     - Testing & commissioning

3. **Sequence & Dependency Mapping**  
   - Realistic sequencing based on on-ground workflows.
   - Example:
     - Containment → Cable Laying → Glanding → Termination → Cold Checks → SCADA Dry Runs

4. **Data-Driven Scheduling**  
   - Applied vendor delivery lead time, manpower analysis, EHS access windows.
   - Duration buffers created based on site historical productivity data.

5. **Live Monitoring & Control**  
   - Weekly updates gathered.
   - Tracked using Excel dashboards with:
     - Green: Completed
     - Blue: In Progress
     - Red: At Risk/Critical
     - Yellow: Delayed but recoverable

## Technical Specifications & Method Statements

- **Prepared Equipment-specific Method Statements** for:
  - GIS Installation & Gas Filling Procedure
  - Transformer Dry-out and Oil Testing
  - Cable Glanding, Termination, and IR/PI Testing
  - Relay Panel Functional Checks
- **Used Site-Specific Layouts** to plan space allocation, inter-bay access, and control cable routing.
- Incorporated **Safe Work Procedures** and **LTA/EHS Mandates** for:
  - Hot Works
  - Confined Space Testing
  - HV Access Clearance

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

| Issue | Impact | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Delay in 66kV Transformer Bushing | Risk to Power ON | Cold test and relay panel activities advanced to absorb delay |
| GIS spare parts from Siemens | Threat to functional checks | Parallel system (LV) tested first, dummy loads used for GIS simulation |
| Site Access Constraints | T&C Execution Lag | Re-sequenced scope to allow night shifts and parallel panels commissioning |

✅ **Result**: Mitigated all major risks with **no slippage** on energization milestone.

---

## Testing & Commissioning Strategy

- **Parallel T&C Execution Plan**:
  - Testing began **per system group** (GIS, Relay Panel, Transformer).
  - Cold checks and dry runs released **before full installation completion**.
- **Smart Overlapping**:
  - GIS checks using simulation
  - Relay panel energized before final cable terminations
- **Outcome**:
  - Reduced idle wait time
  - Increased schedule flexibility
  - Absorbed logistic uncertainties
