## Consortium Responsibility Split

| Partner        | Scope                                                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Siemens**    | Design engineering, supply of all electrical equipment (GIS, panels, transformers, protection relays, SCADA, etc.) |
| **Concord Corporation** | Procurement of 66kV/22kV power cables, containment materials; installation of Siemens equipment; testing and commissioning execution |

---

## Tools Used

| Tool | Purpose |

## Planning Approach ‚Äì Step-by-Step

### 1. **Scope Derivation from L1 Schedule**
- Extracted relevant WBS from Primavera baseline schedule.
- Matched equipment and system tags against actual site delivery schedule.

### 2. **Work Package Definition**
- Created logical workgroups:
  - Containment installation  
  - Cable pulling  
  - Equipment installation  
  - Termination & testing  
  - SCADA connection & energization

### 3. **Sequencing and Dependency Logic**
- Dependencies mapped as per actual workflow, not idealized sequence.
- E.g., cable containment ‚Üí cable laying ‚Üí glanding ‚Üí termination ‚Üí insulation testing ‚Üí SCADA integration

### 4. **Realistic Duration Planning**
- Consulted vendor lead time reports.
- Incorporated EHS access clearance time and third-party inspection schedules.

### 5. **Live Progress Monitoring**
- Weekly updates taken from site supervisors and subcontractors.
- Gantt bars color-coded to reflect real-time status:
  - Green = Complete
  - Blue = In Progress
  - Red = Critical Delay

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation Plan

### Identified Delay: **Spare Parts for 66kV GIS SWG & Power Transformer**

| Issue | Impact | Action Taken |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| Spare parts not delivered on time from Siemens warehouse | Risk to T&C schedule | Mitigated by adjusting the scope sequence ‚Äì began low-voltage system testing and relay panel setup in parallel while waiting |
| Transformer bushing delay | Threat to energization | Closely tracked with Siemens logistics; revised plan to complete cold checks and SCADA dry tests in advance |

**Result**: Despite delays, all activities were realigned and power was successfully turned ON on 06 Jan 2025, without violating the client milestone.

## Testing & Commissioning Integration Strategy

From the beginning, I developed the schedule to **overlap Testing & Commissioning with Installation** to optimize time and manage constraints.

### My T&C Planning Thought Process:
- Installation was divided per system group (GIS, Transformer, Panels, SCADA).
- Once one system was installed and completed cold checks, I **released it for T&C**, rather than waiting for the full installation scope to finish.
- For example:
  - **Relay Panel Testing** was initiated while transformer testing was pending.
  - **GIS functional checks** were done using dummy loads while waiting for final connections.
- This overlapping approach allowed **parallel workflows**, which accelerated delivery and enabled **risk absorption** of potential delays.
